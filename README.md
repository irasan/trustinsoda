## UX

## Strategy

## Goals
To create a recruitment site for people with down syndrome.
Currently in Ireland there is a very small number of people with down syndrome in the work place.
We aim to create a site that gives them a place to find work and employers a place to find and recruit them.
As our MVP we aim to:
* Create an easy to navigate web site for job seekers and employers
* Create a site that allows possible access arrangements to the work place and the interview to be arrange.


### To achieve these goals I will need to:
* Create a website with good accesbility
* Easy to understand site structure and flow
* Ensure the sign up section is clear and easy to find
* Create a UX design that is intuitive to use and flows well
* The users will:
    * Be looking to find work
    * Be able to quickly navigate the site and create a simple profile
    * be able to add any access arngments they may need.

## Functionality

## Load Screen/home page

<img src="document/final-home-page.PNG" width="450" height="250" alt="image of live site title acreen/about section">

The user can see what services are offered by the narrator in the About section, and can see clear navigation options to the Samples section and the Contact section. There is also a call to action at the end of the About section, so the user can be directed to the Contact page. This will make it easier for first time users to navigate the page. The call to action will also help returning users who may be comparing narrators, to quickly navigate to the Contact page.
* The title and subtitle make it clear that the site is for audio book narration and the About section clearly states the services offered
* There is a Nav bar that will send the user to each section of the page
* I decided to turn this site in to a one-page site part way through the project as this will mean that everything the user needs is easy to access
* I used a call to action that links to the Contact section so that the user can quickly navigate to that section of the site
